# Introduction

Peer-to-Peer lending, or P2P lending for short, permits people and organizations to acquire and loan out cash to one another. It works by coordinating lenders with borrowers through internet based stages or offline brokers.

We also noticed that mobile phone usage has skyrocketed in recent years, accompanied by the usage of chatting applications.

Looking at the situation, we created a ChatBot so that lenders could easily fund and invest their money in a P2P Lending platform, without having to leave their beloved messaging applications.

Since they're already used to how their messaging applications work, they would feel comfortable using the app, which would reduce the need of familiarizing with a new application.

In this project, we created our Chatbot to understand and use Indonesian Language, however this could be modified to other languages.

Fintbot is the name of our chatbot name that functions to help lenders in a P2P Lending company. Fintbot assists lenders with funding related activities easily and quickly, such as check balances, fund projects, and withdraw funds.
